## ynabR - YNAB meets R programming language.

* **What is ynabR?** 

  ynabR is a set of R scripts that demonstrates how data from the popular budgeting software, You Need A Budget (YNAB), can be imported, analyzed, and visualized.

* **How does it work?**

  The scripts rely on connecting to YNAB's Application Program Interface (API), and extracting the available data related to accounts, users, monthly budgets, payees, transactions etc... After the appropriate data is extracted, the scripts will focus on analyzing and visualizing such data (e.g. looking to see if month-to-day spending for any budget category is on track with past spending).
  
* **Who will use ynabR**

  This project is for any YNAB user interested in learning about their own budget data. Some basic level of R programming or an interest in learning R programming is necessary.
  
* **What is the goal of this project?**  

  The goal of this project is to enable YNAB users to get a prespective on their own data. It also exists to show others how R can be used. I'm using it as an opportunity to learn R programming.
